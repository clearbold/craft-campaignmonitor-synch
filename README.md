# Campaign Monitor Synch

Synch your Craft members with your Campaign Monitor subscriber lists.

## Installation

To install:

```
composer require clearbold/craft-campaignmonitor-synch
```

## Usage

There's lots more planned for this, but you can check it out and start using it today.

You'll need to enter your Campaign Monitor API Key and Client ID under *Settings > Campaign Monitor Service*.

You can then navigate to **Campaign Monitor Synch** in the control panel sidebar and enter your List ID and change the criteria for your *Users* query.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Batch subscriber imports in 1,000 subscriber chunks (CM constraint)
* [ ] Store imports as a set of rules that can be run with 1 click
* [ ] Enable URL for imports that can be configured as a cron task
* [ ] Move from JSON rules to field-based rule definition
