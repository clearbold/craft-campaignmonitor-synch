# Campaign Monitor Synch

Synch your Craft members with your Campaign Monitor subscriber lists.

To install:

```
composer require clearbold/craft-campaignmonitor-synch
```

There's lots more planned for this, but you can check it out and start using it today.

You'll need to enter your Campaign Monitor API Key and Client ID under *Settings > Campaign Monitor Synch*.

You can then navigate to **Campaign Monitor Synch** in the control panel sidebar and enter your List ID and change the criteria for your *Users* query.
